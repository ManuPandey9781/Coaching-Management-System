# Coaching-Management-System

Hello, This is my very first core python and sql connector project. Basics of python commands such as def, class , object , if else elif statements and print menu options are used on the jupyter notebook. An SQL connection is formed where 1 table is  created to store the data entered by the Coaching Managemet.
